# Playing with transformers
Just some code I wrote to familiarize myself with transformer models.

## Accessing and manipulating internal model activations:

With a custom wrapper module in
[activation_addition_intro.ipynb](https://github.com/annahdo/playing_with_transformers/blob/main/activation_addition_intro.ipynb) and
[activation_addition.ipynb](https://github.com/annahdo/playing_with_transformers/blob/main/activation_addition.ipynb)

With the transformer lens library in
[transformer_lens_intro.ipynb](https://github.com/annahdo/playing_with_transformers/blob/main/transformer_lens_intro.ipynb)

With pytorch hooks in 
[pytorch_hooks.ipynb](https://github.com/annahdo/playing_with_transformers/blob/main/pytorch_hooks.ipynb)

By modifying the biases in 
[activation_addition_in_bias.ipynb](https://github.com/annahdo/playing_with_transformers/blob/main/activation_addition_in_bias.ipynb)
